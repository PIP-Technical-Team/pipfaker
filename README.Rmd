# pipfaker

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to provide users who would like to use (or generate) *fake* [PIP](https://pip.worldbank.org/) data in several formats (raw or cache) and distribution types (micro, group, bin or imputed).

## Installation

You can install the development version of pipfaker from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("PIP-Technical-Team/pipfaker")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use a fake PIP data set:

```{r example}
library(pipfaker)
## basic example code

micro_cache_pip <- fk_cache_micro

mean_welf <- mean(micro_cache_pip$welfare_ppp, w = micro_cache_pip$weight)
mean_welf
```
